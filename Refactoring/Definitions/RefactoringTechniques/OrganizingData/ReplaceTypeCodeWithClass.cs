/// What’s type code?
/// Type code occurs when,
/// instead of a separate data type, you have a set of numbers or strings that form a list of allowable values for some entity.
/// Often these specific numbers and strings are given understandable names via constants,
/// which is the reason for why such type code is encountered so much.
