    public string HowToRefactor()

        return $"1. Create a new subclass from the class of interest." +
               $"{Environment.NewLine}" +
               $"2. If you need additional data to create objects from a subclass, " +

               $"Don’t forget to call the constructor’s parent implementation." +
               $"{Environment.NewLine}" +
               $"3. Find all calls to the constructor of the parent class. " +
               $"When the functionality of a subclass is necessary, replace the parent constructor with the subclass constructor." +
               $"{Environment.NewLine}" +
               $"4. Move the necessary methods and fields from the parent class to the subclass. " +
               $"Do this via Push Down Method and Push Down Field. It’s simpler to start by moving the methods first. " +
               $"This way, the fields remain accessible throughout the whole process: " +
               $"from the parent class prior to the move, and from the subclass itself after the move is complete." +
               $"{Environment.NewLine}" +
               $"5. After the subclass is ready, find all the old fields that controlled the choice of functionality. " +
               $"Delete these fields by using polymorphism to replace all the operators in which the fields had been used. " +
               $"A simple example: in the Car class, you had the field isElectricCar and, depending on it, " +
               $"in the refuel() method the car is either fueled up with gas or charged with electricity. " +
               $"Post-refactoring, the isElectricCar field is removed and the Car and ElectricCar classes " +
               $"will have their own implementations of the refuel() method.";
