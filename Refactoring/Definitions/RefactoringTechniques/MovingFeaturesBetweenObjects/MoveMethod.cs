            $"you should certainly move the feature to it. If the feature is used by other methods too, " +
            $"you should move these methods as well. Sometimes it’s much easier to move a large number of methods " +

            $"Make sure that the method isn’t declared in superclasses and subclasses. " +
            $"If this is the case, you will either have to refrain from moving or else implement a kind of polymorphism " +
            $"in the recipient class in order to ensure varying functionality of a method split up among donor classes." +
            $"{Environment.NewLine}" +
            $"2. Declare the new method in the recipient class. You may want to give a new name for the method " +
            $"that’s more appropriate for it in the new class." +
            $"{Environment.NewLine}" +
            $"3. Decide how you will refer to the recipient class. You may already have a field or method that returns " +
            $"an appropriate object, but if not, you will need to write a new method or field to store " +
            $"the object of the recipient class." +
            $"{Environment.NewLine}" +
            $"Now you have a way to refer to the recipient object and a new method in its class. " +
            $"With all this under your belt, you can turn the old method into a reference to the new method." +
            $"{Environment.NewLine}" +
            $"4. Take a look: can you delete the old method entirely? If so, place a reference to the new method " +
